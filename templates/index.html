Welcome to Derek's Obscure Books. We sell books that nobody read then and nobody reads now. In doing so, we fulfill a life-long dream of both selling books and never having to talk to people. This is truly the greatest place on Earth.

<!-- {% for book in all_books %} -->
<!-- <ul>
    <li>{{book.title}}</li> -->
    <!-- <li>{{book.author.first_name}} {{book.author.last_name}}</li> -->
    <!-- <form class="delete-form" action="/{{book.id}}/delete" method="post">
        <button class="trash-button">

        </button>
    </form> -->
